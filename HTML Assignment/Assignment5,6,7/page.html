      <summary>Java</summary>
      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
      that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
      It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
      write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
      platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java
      applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
      virtual machine regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
      syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities
      than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities that
      are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019,
      Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
      GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9
      million developers.
